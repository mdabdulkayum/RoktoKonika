# Project Name: Rokto konika

# Description
  Every drop of blood is potential lifeline. An estimated 600,000 blood bags are required annually in Bangladesh. There is a significant amount of communication failure in our nation between blood banks, hospitals, donors, and patients. The challenge of finding a compatible blood donor during critical times remains a big problem. Traditional methods of finding donors take too much time and aren't very effective, making it even harder during urgent medical situations. Geographic constraints, a lack of real-time information, and the complexity of matching blood types make it tough to get the right blood on time. This pressing problem necessitates a more simplified and technologically advanced solution to ensure that life-saving support gets to the people who need it fast and efficiently.

  Introducing an innovative Blood Donation App named Rokto Konika– a lifeline connecting donors and those in need. This app redefines the way society deals with blood shortages. By seamlessly bridging the gap between donors and recipients, users can effortlessly identify donors, request emergency blood and foster a community committed to saving lives.

  Rokto Konika is a blood donation mobile application where registered users can make blood request posts, see blood request posts, get notification of the request, and search for donors with the comparative blood group. Also, there is an account option where users can see their profile details and own posts.  To register in Rokto Konika, users need to enter their full name, valid phone number, gender, blood group, division, and district, and choose a minimum 6 digit password. After clicking the register button, an OTP will be sent to the given phone number. The user must verify it. After verifying the OTP, their details will be stored in the database. And they logged in to their account and saw the dashboard. In the dashboard, the user will see the option that is mentioned. When a user makes a blood request post, they have to enter their contact’s name, contact phone number, patient gender, patient blood group, blood quantity, donation address, and date. All the information will be stored in the database.
